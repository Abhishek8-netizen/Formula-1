            The F1 Sprint is a short race. It covers 100km - about one-third of a typical Grand Prix distance - and
            should last about 30 minutes.
            <br><br>
            While the bulk of the Formula 1 season consists of traditional Grand Prix weekends, six of them - a quarter
            of the 24 events in total - have been designated F1 Sprint events.
            <br><br>
            A Sprint is still a three-day affair with the Grand Prix as the main event, but the Sprint Qualifying
            session (which sets the grid for the Sprint) replaces FP2 on Friday afternoon. The Sprint itself takes place
            on Saturday (in place of FP3), before Qualifying for the Grand Prix happens as normal.
            <br><br>
            The venues chosen for Sprint events are all tracks with great overtaking potential, picked to try and ensure
            the Sprint is a flat-out, aggressive melee from start to finish. Points are on offer, from eight down to
            one, awarded to the first eight cars to finish.
