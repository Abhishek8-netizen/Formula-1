                <p>
                    The red tyre signifies the soft compound, designed for maximum grip and performance over shorter
                    stints. It offers top lap times but wears out quickly, ideal for qualifying and short races.
                    Typically <strong>C5</strong> compounds has red sidewalls, but also <strong>C3</strong>,
                    <strong>C4</strong>, and <strong>C6</strong> can be used.

                <h1><strong>C1</strong></h1>
                <h3>The Ultimate Hard Compound</h3>
                <p>
                    The hardest compound will be nominated for the circuits that take the most energy out of the tyres.
                    It's designed to provide maximum resistance to heat and extreme forces, being capable of running
                    very long stints.

                <h3>Engineered for Extreme Durability</h3>
                <p>
                    The second-hardest compound remains very suited to the faster, hotter and more abrasive circuits.
                    These compounds are sometimes nominated for new circuits.
                </p>

                <h1><strong>C3</strong></h1>
                <h3>A Versatile Compound</h3>
                <p>
                    This compound is extremely versatile and can be used as either the hardest, the middle or the
                    softest of any three-compound selection. With an excellent balance between performance and
                    durability, this is well-suited to a wide range of conditions.

                <h1><strong>C4</strong></h1>
                <h3>Swift Heating, Superior Heating</h3>
                <p>
                    This compound is designated to work well on low-severity circuits, where quite a quick warm up is
                    required in order to reach peak performance as soon as possible. This tyre is used extensively
                    throughout the season.

                <h3>Maximum Softness for Peak Speed</h3>
                <p>
                    These are designed for the slowest circuits with low wear and degradation where maximum mechanical
                    grip is required from the rubber. These are normally seen where the asphalt is exceptionally smooth.

                <h3>The Queen of Street Circuits</h3>
                <p>
                    It's the new compound for 2025 and the softest in the Pirelli range. Its use will be limited to city
                    circuits, where its high degradation will lead teams to make more pit stops than in the past, making
                    races more unpredictable.

                <h2>Green</h2>
                <h4>Intermediate</h4>
                <p>
                    The intermediates are the most versatile of the rain tyres. They can be used on a wet track with no
                    standing water, as well as a drying surface. The compound has been designed to have a wide working
                    range, guaranteeing a wide crossover window both with the slicks and the full wets.

                <h2>Blue</h2>
                <h4>Full Wet</h4>
                <p>
                    The full wet tyres are the most effective for heavy rain, capable of dispersing impressive
                    quantities of water. But if it rains heavily, visibility rather than grip causes issues, leading to
                    race stoppages on occasions. The profile delivers increased resistance to aquaplaning, which gives
                    the tyre more grip in heavy rain.
